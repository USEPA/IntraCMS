It is primarily a management tool and secondarily a technical tool. It is not a tool for individual employee appraisal. As a component of the EPA Quality System, the audit enables management to determine whether the systems are being implemented as planned. It also establishes the basis for taking action to correct any deficiencies that are discovered. A well-planned and carefully-conducted audit will minimize the collection or use of invalid data and prevent costly rework. Audits are most useful in addressing the following questions:</p><ul><li>Does the system comply with its quality assurance (QA) and related planning documents?</li><li>Are the procedures defined in these documents implemented effectively?</li><li>Are the existing procedures effective in achieving the system's quality goals?</li><li>Are the environmental data collected in the system scientifically defensible?</li></ul><p>The major types of audits that are performed in individual ORD organizations are described in the ORD QMP and include the following:</p><p><strong>Quality System Audit (QSA</strong>) is an evaluation of an organization\u2019s practices as they relate to its quality system, rather than its technical systems, for environmental data collection. It seeks to determine if a quality system is implemented and is operating in the manner prescribed by the organization\u2019s or program\u2019s approved QMP. According to ANSI/ASQC E4-2014 (8), assessments of environmental programs should be conducted periodically to measure the effectiveness of the programs\u2019 quality systems. This requirement has been invoked as part of EPA Order CIO 2105.0 (5). Refer to EPA QA/G-3 (3), <i>Guidance on Assessing Quality Systems</i>, for further information about QSAs.</p><p><strong>Technical Systems Audit (TSA)</strong> is a qualitative, on-site evaluation of an environmental data collection research effort. The objective of a TSA is to evaluate all facilities, measurement instrumentation, operating procedures, reporting requirements, and quality control (QC) procedures. The justification and audit standard for the TSA is typically the approved QAPP for the project. Refer to EPA QA/G-7 (4), <i>Guidance on Technical Audits and Related Assessments for Environmental Data Operations</i>, for further information about TSAs.</p><p><strong>Surveillance</strong> is the on-site observation by QA staff, of ongoing environmental data collection to document conformance with applicable requirements and/or procedures, such as those given in a laboratory/facility manual, QAPP or SOP. It is focused on a specific technical activity, rather than on the entire technical system. It is typically less formal than other types of audits, but it should also include appropriate preparation, conducting, reporting, and follow-up phases. It may be helpful for verifying the adequacy of new laboratory operations, including analysts running new methods or using new instrumentation. The justification for and the audit standard for the surveillance is typically identified in the approved QAPP for the project.</p><p><strong>Notebook Review</strong> is an independent examination of research notebooks while they are in use. The purpose of the review is to improve research documentation with the primary objective being to ensure elements of the research are documented and that the documentation allows peer researchers to understand and reproduce results. Each researcher must ensure the defensibility of data used to support EPA's regulatory mission. The review provides the QA staff, supervisor, mentor or PI feedback on items in the research notebook that may affect data quality and study re-constructability. The review applies to the bound paper notebooks; ring binder notebooks for data and field sheets; and electronic notebooks, all of which have a slightly different manner in which they are reviewed. Refer to PPM 13.2 (6), <i>Paper Laboratory Records</i> and PPM 13.6 (8), <i>Scientific Recordkeeping: Electronic </i>for further information about the reviews.</p><p><strong>Proficiency/Performance Evaluation (PE)</strong> is a quantitative evaluation of a technical system or component thereof to evaluate the proficiency of an analyst or laboratory. Quantitative data generated from the measurement of an independent reference standard are compared to the certified value for the standard. Alternatively, quantitative data generated from the system's measurement of an environmental sample are compared to data generated by an independent measurement of the same sample. The justification for and the audit standard for the PE typically is identified in the approved QAPP for the project. The PE may be used to demonstrate analyst proficiency with a given method prior to analyzing research samples. PE samples may be procured from accredited commercial sources or they may be prepared by the auditor. PE samples may be shipped to the auditee to be analyzed blind (certified value unknown) with the results reported to the auditor.</p><p><strong>Audit of Data Quality (ADQ)</strong> is an independent examination of data after they have been collected and verified by project staff. It determines how well the technical system performed with respect to the performance goals specified in the QAPP and whether the data were accumulated, transferred, reduced, calculated, summarized, and reported correctly. The justification for and the audit standard for the ADQ typically is identified in the project's QAPP.</p><p><strong>Data Quality Assessment (DQA)</strong> is a statistical and scientific evaluation of data sets to determine the validity and performance of the data collection design and statistical analysis and to determine the adequacy of the data set for its intended use. In ORD, data quality assessments are limited to those projects for which formal data quality objectives were developed. Refer to EPA QA/G-9R (2), <i>Data Quality Assessment: A Reviewer\u2019s Guide</i>, for more information about DQAs.</p><p><strong>Laboratory Competency Assessment (LCA)</strong> is an external technical evaluation of laboratory operations. Competency means that an organization has the equipment, instrumentation, staff, and demonstrated analyst proficiency needed to generate valid environmental measurement data that meet the project needs. Refer to PPM 13.10 (10), <i>Laboratory Competency Assessments</i> for further information about ORD\u2019s use of LCAs.</p><p><strong>Readiness Review</strong> is a technical audit that is planned and performed prior to the initiation of a project to verify that project management has brought the facility and/or applicable technical systems to a state of readiness to begin the project. EPA has not traditionally used readiness reviews, but the principles can be used to ensure that all parts of an EPA program are in place and ready for the start of a project. TSAs can be scheduled to serve as readiness reviews.</p>",
